# Project 3 (RNA-Seq Plants)
## Introduction
In this project, analysis of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaf's response to UV stress in the vasculature was conducted using Bash and RStudio. The objectives include the following: 
1) To perform differential expression analysis in the vasculature of UV treated <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> tissues with Water (control) and UV-C light
2) To determine the top 100 differentially expressed genes of the two groups of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> tissues
3) To determine the top 5 enriched pathways of the two groups of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> tissues
